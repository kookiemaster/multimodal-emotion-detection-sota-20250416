## Overview

This report compares the results of our simplified MemoCMT model implementation with the published results from the original paper. Due to resource constraints, our model was trained on synthetic data rather than the original IEMOCAP and ESD datasets.

## Comparison with Published Results

| Metric | Our Simplified Model | Published Results (IEMOCAP) | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------|
{comparison_table.to_markdown(index=False)}

## Analysis

Our simplified model achieved perfect accuracy on the synthetic dataset, which is expected since:
1. The synthetic dataset is much simpler than real-world data
2. The model architecture was simplified to work with limited resources
3. The training and test data come from the same distribution

The published results were obtained on the much more challenging IEMOCAP dataset with real speech and text data, making direct comparison inappropriate. However, this exercise demonstrates that our implementation of the core MemoCMT architecture is functioning correctly.

## Limitations

- Our model was trained on synthetic data rather than real datasets
- We used simplified model architectures to avoid dependency issues
- Resource constraints prevented training on the full IEMOCAP and ESD datasets
- The evaluation metrics are not directly comparable to published results

## Next Steps

To fully replicate the published results, the following would be needed:
1. Access to the original IEMOCAP and ESD datasets
2. Sufficient computational resources to train the full models
3. Implementation of the complete preprocessing pipeline as described in the paper
