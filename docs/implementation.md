# Implementation Details

This document provides detailed information about the implementation of the multimodal emotion detection system.

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Text Emotion Detection**: Processes text input and predicts emotions using a DeBERTa-based model.
2. **Voice Emotion Detection**: Processes audio input and predicts emotions using a Semi-CNN architecture.
3. **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines predictions from text and voice modalities using an attention mechanism.

## Text Emotion Detection

### Model Architecture

The text emotion detection component uses a DeBERTa-v3-small model with a classification head:

- **Base Model**: DeBERTa-v3-small (68M parameters)
- **Classification Head**: Linear layer mapping from hidden size to number of emotion classes
- **Input**: Tokenized text sequences
- **Output**: Emotion probabilities

### Feature Extraction

Text features are extracted using the DeBERTa tokenizer and model:

1. Text is tokenized using the DeBERTa tokenizer
2. Tokens are passed through the DeBERTa model
3. The [CLS] token representation is used for classification

## Voice Emotion Detection

### Model Architecture

The voice emotion detection component uses a Semi-CNN architecture:

- **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional layers for extracting features from mel-spectrograms
- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM layers for capturing temporal patterns
- **Classification Head**: Fully connected layers for emotion classification
- **Input**: Mel-spectrograms from audio signals
- **Output**: Emotion probabilities

### Feature Extraction

Audio features are extracted using the following process:

1. Audio is loaded and resampled to 16kHz
2. Mel-spectrograms are computed using librosa
3. Spectrograms are segmented into fixed-length windows
4. Features are passed through the Semi-CNN model
